		  				<ul>

		  					<li>Founder</li>
		  				</ul>
		  			</h2>
		  			<p>Livia was born into a modest Italian family in a small village near Florence. At the age of 18, she went to Rome to study art at a renowned school. Livia began working for top fashion houses in Milan, and it was in the 1990s that she decided to create her own. Seeing that she was having trouble finding high-end clothes that she could still wear to the office, she decided to dedicate herself to solving this problem. In 1994, De Marzi was born. For Livia, this brand had to embellish man and woman while keeping a comfortable and extremely qualitative side. </p>

		  				</ul>
		  			</h2>
		  			<p>It was in 2014 that Livia sold De Marzi, in order to slip away for her retirement. Aurore Vanhove, then managing director of the Lanvin company, fell in love with the project and bought the house. A committed feminist, Aurore continues to keep the spirit of the De Marzi house by dressing up the most powerful man and woman with the best quality products. </p>

		  				</ul>
		  			</h2>
		  			<p>Aware of the modern global challenges, it was in 2015 that Aurore Vanhove decided to deepen the purpose of the brand. In a world where the textile industry is one of the most polluting, she decided to make the brand an example in the luxury industry. To do this, she surrounds herself with the most qualified people in this field. She therefore appoints Cannelle Platiau as executive director, formerly CEO of WWF. Canelle has enabled De Marzi to revolutionize its production chain, and thus considerably reduce its carbon footprint.</p>

		  			<p>After the passage of several artistic directors and in particular the famous Albert Elbaz, De Marzi set out in search of a new touch of modernsiem, in accordance with the recent commitments of the brand. Tara Naizin, then freshly graduated from the French Fashion Institute (IFM) school, has proven herself by creating unique pieces, in accordance with the values of the house.</p>

		  			<p>Tara Naizin's successful collaboration with the De Marzi team allowed them to focus more on the values of the house. More and more loyal customers are very attached to the quality and sustainability of products. It was therefore essential to hire a textile designer. Sophie Lemarchand, former logistics director of a textile manufacturing chain, has embarked on the adventure with the aim of changing the world of the textile industry by revolutionizing luxury and its sources of supply.</p>
